//COLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

//for the terminal class...
    //i would make it so it can store one plane at a time and if two plances get added then the terminal is closed aka two planes collided
    //same for the runway class
    //after some amount of time. the terminal will reopen due to the fire fighters get it cleaned up leave that to me. just have a fuction that can change its open status
    
    // the goal is that i am going to make it a array that i can put in the graphics class
    
    //i am going to look up threads so we can run two things at once. i have done this once before.
    //i found somthing for threads and cloud 9 supports it so its a go!
    
    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    
    //threads are unsucessful :(
    
    //there is still a way to get this to work
    //using a text file as the command propt kind of thing
    //put in commands to send it to the program
    //i will figure that out and make some functions for it
